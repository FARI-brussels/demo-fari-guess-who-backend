Then a request is sent to openai api to check wich card are eliminated by the question. and the card that are eliminated are faded away until there is only one

+    }
+    
+    for message in messages:
+        if message["role"] == "system":
+            print(colored(f"system: {message['content']}\n", role_to_color[message["role"]]))

+Basic concepts
+Let's create some function specifications to interface with a hypothetical weather API. We'll pass these function specification to the Chat Completions API in order to generate function arguments that adhere to the specification.

+]
+
+If we prompt the model about the current weather, it will respond with some clarifying questions.
+
+messages = []
+messages.append({"role": "system", "content": "Don't make assumptions about what values to plug into functions. Ask for clarification if a user request is ambiguous."})
+messages.append({"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather like today"})
